(1954)

Muzafer Sherif's study explored intergroup conflict and cooperation. Two groups of boys at a summer camp were placed in competition with each other, leading to hostility and aggression. However, when the groups were given shared goals that required cooperation, the hostility diminished, and friendships formed.
