In any given partnership, there is always one person who holds more power than the other. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as financial stability, physical attractiveness, or emotional intelligence. The person with more power often manipulates the other, whether consciously or unconsciously, to maintain their position of dominance. This can manifest in various ways, such as controlling behavior, emotional manipulation, or even infidelity.
