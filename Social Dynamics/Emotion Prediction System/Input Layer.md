The input layer of the Emotion Prediction System (EPS) is designed to collect and process various types of data that contribute to a person's emotional state. This layer is composed of multiple nodes, each representing a specific input factor. The input factors are categorized into five main groups:

1. Physiological Data: This group includes biometric information such as heart rate, skin conductance, body temperature, and blood pressure. These data points can be collected using wearable devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers.

2. Facial Expressions: This group focuses on capturing facial cues that indicate emotions, such as smiling, frowning, or raised eyebrows. Advanced computer vision algorithms and cameras can be used to analyze and interpret these expressions.

3. Voice Tone: This group deals with the analysis of a person's voice, including pitch, volume, and speech rate. By using natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the system can identify emotions based on vocal patterns.

4. Body Language: This group captures non-verbal cues such as posture, gestures, and eye movements. These cues can be detected using motion sensors, cameras, or other tracking devices.

5. Contextual Information: This group includes external factors that may influence a person's emotional state, such as location, time, weather, and recent events. This information can be gathered from various sources like GPS, calendars, or news feeds.

Each input factor has an associated weight, which represents its importance in determining the overall emotional state. These weights can be adjusted based on individual preferences or through machine learning algorithms that optimize the system's accuracy.

The input layer processes the collected data and converts it into a standardized format, which is then passed on to the next layer in the EPS for further analysis and emotion prediction.
