$$E = \frac{F}{Q}$$

where
	$F$ is the [[Force]] experienced by a charged object in the field
	$Q$ is the charge of the object

$$E = \frac{k_e \cdot Q}{r^2}$$

where
	$Q$ is the charge of the object
	$k_e$ is the [[Electrostatic Constant]]
	$r$ is the distance between charged objects


description
	Electric field strength is a vector quantity that describes the amount of force experienced by a charged particle
