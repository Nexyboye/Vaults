description
	The equation is a partial differential equation that relates the wave function of a quantum system to its energy and potential.


Time-dependent Schrödinger equation
$$Ĥψ(x, t) = iħ(\frac{∂ψ(x, t)}{∂t})$$

where
- $Ĥ$ is the [[Hamiltonian Operator]]
- $ψ(x, t)$ is the wave function of the system
- $ħ$ is the reduced Planck constant
- $i$ is the imaginary unit


description
	This form of the equation describes the time evolution of a quantum system's wave function.



Time-independent Schrödinger equation
$$Ĥψ(x) = Eψ(x)$$

where
- $Ĥ$ is the [[Hamiltonian Operator]]
- $E$ is the energy eigenvalue of the system

description
	This form of the equation is used for stationary states, where the system's wave function does not change with time.
