$$∇²ψ = \frac{1}{c²} \frac{∂²ψ}{∂t²}$$

where:
- $∇²$ is the Laplacian operator, which represents the sum of the second derivatives with respect to each spatial coordinate (x, y, z)
- $ψ$ is the wave function, which represents the amplitude or displacement of the wave at a given point in space and time
- $c$ is the speed of the wave in the medium
- $t$ is Time



The wave equation can be written in one, two, or three dimensions, depending on the problem being studied. In one dimension, the wave equation simplifies to:
$$\frac{∂²ψ}{∂x²} = \frac{1}{c²} \frac{∂²ψ}{∂t²}$$
