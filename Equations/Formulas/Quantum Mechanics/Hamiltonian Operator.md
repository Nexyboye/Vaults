$$Ĥ = T + V$$

where
- $T$ is the kinetic energy operator
- $V$ is the potential energy operator


description
	It is an operator that represents the total energy of a quantum system, including both kinetic and potential energy. The Hamiltonian operator is used to describe the time evolution of quantum states and to solve the Schrödinger equation, which is the central equation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.



T = -ħ² / (2m) ∇²


According to the Schrödinger equation, the time evolution of a quantum state |ψ(t)⟩ is given by:

iħ ∂|ψ(t)⟩ / ∂t = Ĥ |ψ(t)⟩
