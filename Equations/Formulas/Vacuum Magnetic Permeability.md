$$μ_0 = \frac{2 ~ h ~ α}{c ~ e ~ 2}$$

where
- $h$ is the [[Planck Constant]]
- $\alpha$ is the [[Fine Structure Constant]]
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
- $e$ is the [[Elementary Charge]]

$$μ_0 = 4 ~ \pi ~ 10^{-7} ~ \frac{H}{m}$$

It is not 100% accurate according to measurements but I dont give a fuck honestly.

Update: the value was fixed by the 2019 SI redefinition so I was right.
