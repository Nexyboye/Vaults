SOUND WAVE
$$E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot ρ \cdot v \cdot A^2 \cdot f \cdot t$$

where
	$ρ$ is the [[Density]] of the medium through which the sound wave is traveling 
	$v$ is the speed of sound in the medium
	$A$ is the amplitude of the sound wave (in meters)
	$f$ is the frequency of the sound wave 
	$t$ is the time the sound wave is present
