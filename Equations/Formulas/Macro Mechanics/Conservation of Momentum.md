$$m1 \cdot u1 + m2 \cdot u2 = m1 \cdot v1 + m2 \cdot v2$$

where
	$m$ is the [[Mass]]
	$u$ is the initial velocity
	$v$ is the final velocity

extra
	The NET mass and velocity of a system cannot be changed internally, according to this shit. Btw it is not true, because of the mass-energy equalence.
