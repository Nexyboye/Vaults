$$∮ E • dA = \frac{Q_{enclosed}}{ε_0}$$

where:
- $∮$ represents a surface integral or a flux integral
- $E$ is the electric field,
- $dA$ is a differential area on the closed surface,
- $Q_{enclosed}$ is the total charge enclosed by the surface,
- $ε_0$ is the [[Vacuum Electric Permittivity]].

description
	Gauss's Law, also known as Gauss's Flux Theorem, is a law stating that the total flux of the electric field E over any closed surface is equal to 1/ε times the total charge enclosed by the surface. It is one of the four Maxwell's equations which form the basis of classical electrodynamics.
