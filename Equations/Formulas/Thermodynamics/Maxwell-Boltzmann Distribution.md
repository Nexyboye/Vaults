$$f(v) = (\frac{m}{2 ~ π ~ k_B ~ T})^{\frac{3}{2}} \cdot 4~ π ~ v^2 \cdot exp(\frac{-m~v^2}{2 ~ k_B ~ T})$$

where
- $m$ is the mass of the particle,
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature,
- $v$ is the speed of the particle,
- $exp$ is the exponential function.

description
	The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is a statistical law in physics that describes the distribution of speeds for a gas particle in an ideal gas, a theoretical gas composed of a large number of randomly moving point particles. This distribution was first defined by James Clerk Maxwell in 1860 and later generalized by Ludwig Boltzmann.	
	The distribution provides the probability of a particle being found at a given speed at a certain temperature and is dependent on the mass of the particle and the temperature of the gas. It is a fundamental result derived from kinetic theory of gases, which describes how the individual microscopic properties of gas particles (like speed and momentum) relate to the macroscopic properties we can observe (like temperature and pressure).
	The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is crucial in understanding many aspects of gas behavior and properties, including diffusion, effusion, and thermal conductivity. It is also used in the study of other phenomena such as the behavior of white dwarf stars.
