$$Δs² = c²Δt² - Δx² - Δy² - Δz²$$

where
	$Δs$ is the spacetime interval
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
	$Δt$ is the [[Time Interval]]
	$Δx$, $Δy$, and $Δz$ are the differences in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ spatial coordinates between the two events


alternatively, more informatively
$$s^2 = (ct)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$$

	basicly the same as the Line Element
