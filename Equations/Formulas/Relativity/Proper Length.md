$$L_0 = \int\sqrt{g_{ij} ~ dx^i ~ dx^j}$$

where:
- $L_0$ is the proper length
- $g_{ij}$ is the [[Metric Tensor]]
- $dx^i$ and $dx^j$ are infinitesimal coordinate displacements
- The integral is taken along the path between the two events

description:
The proper length is an invariant quantity in general relativity, meaning it is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. It is used to describe the distance between two events in curved spacetime, taking into account the effects of gravity and the curvature of spacetime.
