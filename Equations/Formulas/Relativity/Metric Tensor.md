$$ds² = g_{ij} \cdot dx^i \cdot dx^j$$

where
	$ds²$ is the squared infinitesimal distance between two points
	$g_{ij}$ is the metric tensor (a symmetric, positive-definite matrix)
	$dx^i$ and $dx^j$ are the infinitesimal coordinate differences between the two points
	The indices $i$ and $j$ run from 1 to the dimension of the space (e.g., 1 to 3 for a 3-dimensional space), 0 would be time

definition
	The metric tensor equation, also known as the line element, is a fundamental equation in differential geometry and general relativity that describes the infinitesimal distance between two points in a curved space.
