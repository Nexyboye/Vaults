$$G_{μν} + Λ \cdot g_{μν} = κ \cdot T_{μν}$$

where
	$G_{μν}$ is the [[Einstein Tensor]]
	$g_{μν}$ is the [[Metric Tensor]]
	$T_{μν}$ is the [[Stress-Energy Tensor]]
	$Λ$ is the [[Cosmological Constant]]
	$κ$ is the [[Einstein Gravitational Constant]]+

description
	relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter within it. The solution to it is the Schwarzschild metric.
