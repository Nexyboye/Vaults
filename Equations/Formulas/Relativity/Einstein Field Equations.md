$$G_{μν} + Λ \cdot g_{μν} = \frac{8 \cdot π \cdot G}{c^4} \cdot T_{μν}$$

where
	$G_{μν}$ is the [[Einstein Tensor]], which represents the curvature of spacetime.
	$g_{μν}$ is the [[Metric Tensor]], which describes the geometry of spacetime.
	$T_{μν}$ is the [[Stress-Energy Tensor]], which contains information about the distribution of matter and energy.
	$Λ$ is the [[Cosmological Constant]], which represents a uniform energy density of the vacuum.
	$G$ is the [[Gravitational Constant]], which determines the strength of gravity.
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]] in a vacuum.
