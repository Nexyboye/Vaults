$$r = r_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - Î²^2}$$

where:
- $r_0$ is the [[Proper Length]] (length at rest)
- $\beta$ is the [[Relativistic Velocity]]

description:
	Length contraction is a phenomenon in special relativity where the length of an object moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light appears shorter to an observer at rest relative to the object. The contraction occurs only in the direction of motion and is given by the formula above.
