velocity time dilation
$$t_v = \frac{t_0} {\sqrt{1 - β^2}}$$

where
$t_0$ is the [[Proper Time]]
$β$ is the [[Relativistic Velocity]]
$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]





gravitational time dilation
$$t_g = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2Gm_0}{rc^2}}}$$

where
	$t_0$ is the [[Proper Time]]
	$G$ is the [[Gravitational Constant]]
	$m_0$ is the [[Proper Mass]]
	$r$ is the [[Radius]] or radial coordinate
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]


and lastly
$$t = t_v \cdot t_g$$
