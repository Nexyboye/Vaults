for massless objects
$$t = \frac{t_0} {\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$

where
$t_0$ is the [[Proper Time]] that the observed object observes
$v$ is the [[Relativistic Velocity]] between the two observers
$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]





gravitational time dilation
$$t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2Gm_0}{rc^2}}}$$

where
	$t_0$ is the [[Proper Time]]
	$G$ is the [[Gravitational Constant]]
	$m_0$ is the [[Proper Mass]]
	$r$ is the [[Radius]] or radial coordinate
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]


To combine the two, we have the Schwarzschild metric
