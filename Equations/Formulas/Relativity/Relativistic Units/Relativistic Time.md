velocity time dilation
$$t_v = t_0 ~ \gamma$$

where
- $t_0$ is the [[Proper Time]]
- $\gamma$ is the [[Lorentz Factor]]
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]





gravitational time dilation
$$t_g = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2 ~ G ~ m_0}{r ~ c^2}}}$$

where
	$t_0$ is the [[Proper Time]]
	$G$ is the [[Gravitational Constant]]
	$m_0$ is the [[Proper Mass]]
	$r$ is the [[Radius]] or radial coordinate
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]


and lastly
$$t = t_v ~ t_g$$
