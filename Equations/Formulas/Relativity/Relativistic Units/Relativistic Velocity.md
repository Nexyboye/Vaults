$$v = v_A - v_B$$

where:
- $v$ is the relative velocity
- $v_A$ is the velocity of the observed object
- $v_B$ is the velocity of the observer

description:
	The relative velocity is the velocity of one object as seen by an observer in another object. It is calculated by subtracting the velocity of object B from the velocity of object A.
