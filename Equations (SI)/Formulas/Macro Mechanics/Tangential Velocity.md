$$v_t = ω \cdot r$$

where
	$ω$ is the [[Angular Velocity]]
	$r$ is the [[Radius]] of the circular path

description
	Tangential velocity is the linear speed of an object moving along a circular path or orbit at a particular distance from the center of rotation or curvature. It represents the component of the object's velocity that is tangent to the path, meaning it is directed in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting the object to the center of curvature. In other words, tangential velocity is the rate at which an object moves in a circle without moving either towards or away from the center of rotation.
