$$I = \frac{P}{A}$$

where
$P$ is the [[Power]] of the wave
$A$ is the [[Area]] over which the wave is spread

description
	The intensity formula is used to calculate the intensity (I) of a wave, such as sound or light, at a given point. It is defined as the power (P) of the wave divided by the area (A) over which the wave is spread.
