Schwarzschild Metric
$$ds² = -(\frac{1 - 2GM}{c²r}) dt² + (\frac{1 - 2GM}{c²r})⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)$$

where:
	$G$ is the [[Gravitational Constant]]
	$M$ is the [[Mass]] of the object
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
	$r$, $θ$, and $φ$ are the spherical coordinates
	$t$ is the time coordinate
	$dt²$, $dr²$, $dθ²$, and $dφ²$ are the differentials of the respective coordinates























$$Δs² = c²Δt² - Δx² - Δy² - Δz²$$

where
	$Δs$ is the spacetime interval
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
	$Δt$ is the [[Time Interval]]
	$Δx$, $Δy$, and $Δz$ are the differences in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ spatial coordinates between the two events


alternatively, more informatively
$$s^2 = (ct)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$$

description
	basicly the same as the Line Element
