$$T^{\mu\nu} = (\rho + p)u^{\mu}u^{\nu} + p \cdot g^{\mu\nu}$$

where
	$ρ$ is the energy density
	$p$ is the pressure
	$u^μ$ is the 4-velocity vector of the fluid element
	$g^{μν}$ is the metric tensor (which describes the geometry of spacetime)

definition
	The stress-energy tensor (also called the energy-momentum tensor) is a fundamental concept in general relativity and describes the distribution of energy, momentum, and stress in spacetime. It is usually denoted by T^μν (where μ and ν are indices ranging from 0 to 3) and is a symmetric 4x4 matrix.
