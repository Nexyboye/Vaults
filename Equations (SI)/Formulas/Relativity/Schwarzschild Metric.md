$$ds² = -(\frac{1 - 2GM}{c²r}) dt² + (\frac{1 - 2GM}{c²r})⁻¹ dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)$$

where:
	$ds²$ is the [[Spacetime Interval]]
	$G$ is the [[Gravitational Constant]]
	$M$ is the [[Mass]] of the object
	$c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
	$r$, $θ$, and $φ$ are the spherical coordinates
	$t$ is the time coordinate
	$dt²$, $dr²$, $dθ²$, and $dφ²$ are the differentials of the respective coordinates

description
	The Schwarzschild metric formula is a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity that describes the gravitational field outside a spherical, non-rotating mass like a star or a black hole.
