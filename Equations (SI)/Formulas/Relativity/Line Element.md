general equation
$$ds^2 = g_{ij} ~ dx^i ~ dx^j$$

where:
- $g_{ij}$ are the components of the metric tensor
- $dx^i$ and $dx^j$ are the infinitesimal coordinate differences.


in 4-dimensional spacetime with Cartesian coordinates:
$$ds^2 = -c^2 ~ dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2$$

where:
- $c$ is the [[Speed of Light]]
- $dt$ is the change in time
- $dx$ is the change in the x-coordinate
- $dy$ is the change in the y-coordinate
- $dz$ is the change in the z-coordinate

description:
	The line element (ds^2) is a fundamental concept in differential geometry and general relativity, representing the squared infinitesimal distance between two nearby points in spacetime. It is used to describe the geometry of spacetime and the behavior of objects within it.
	The line element is a quadratic form that describes the infinitesimal distance between two points in the space.
