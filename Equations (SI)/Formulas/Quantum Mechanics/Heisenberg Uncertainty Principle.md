$$Δx \cdot Δp ≥ \frac{ħ}{2}$$

where 
- $Δx$ represents the uncertainty in position
- $Δp$ represents the uncertainty in momentum
- $ħ$ is the [[Reduced Planck Constant]]


description
	The principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum of a particle cannot be smaller than half of the reduced Planck constant.
