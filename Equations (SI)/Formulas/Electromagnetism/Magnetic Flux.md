$$Φ = B ~ A ~ cos(θ)$$

where
- $B$ is the magnetic field strength
- $A$ is the area through which the field lines pass
- $θ$ is the angle between the magnetic field lines and the normal (perpendicular) to the area A.

description
	Magnetic flux is a measurement of the total magnetic field which passes through a given area. It is a scalar quantity, typically measured in Weber (Wb) or Maxwells.
