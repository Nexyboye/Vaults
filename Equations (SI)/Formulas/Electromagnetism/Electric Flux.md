$$Φ = E \cdot A \cdot cos(θ)$$

where
	$E$ is the [[Electric Field Strength]]
	$A$ is the area through which the electric field passes
	$θ$ is the angle between the electric field direction and the normal to the surface


$$Φ = E • S$$

where
	$E$ is the [[Electric Field Strength]]
	$S$ is the vector area
	$•$ is the dot product between the electric field vector and the vector area
